# Code Intelligence MCP Server 🧠🚀

A lightweight, high-performance Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides semantic code search and AST-aware indexing for your AI agents. Powered by **Tree-sitter** for intelligent parsing and **LanceDB** for local vector storage.

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. Stdout Fortress 🏰
Rigorous stdout protection ensures the MCP protocol is never corrupted by library background noise.
- **Redirection**: All `print()` calls are automatically forced to `stderr`.
- **Integrity**: Standardized JSON-RPC stream for 100% reliability in Antigravity.

### 2. Multi-Project Isolation 🛡️
Strict isolation for multiple concurrent projects:
- **Per-Project Tables**: Each project gets a unique table in a central database based on its root path hash.
- **Zero Conflict**: Run multiple agents on different projects without write-lock contention.
- **Unified Store**: All data lives centrally in `~/.code_intel_store/`, keeping your project repos clean.

### 3. Smart AST Parsing & Deep Insights 🌳
- **Semantic Chunking**: Uses Tree-sitter to intelligently extract functions and classes instead of blind text slicing.
- **Architectural Insights (Deep Insights)**:
    - **Dependency Hubs**: Identifies the "connectivity" of your project by tracking the most imported files.
    - **Test Gap Analysis**: Correlates cyclomatic complexity with test presence to identify high-risk, unverified code.
    - **Complexity Scoring**: Calculates Cyclomatic Complexity for all semantic chunks.
    - **Test Mapping**: Bidirectionally links source files to their corresponding test files via path heuristics.
- **Language Support**: Python, JS, TS, HTML, CSS, Go, Rust, Java, C++, Dart, SQL.

### 4. Cross-File Symbol Intelligence 🧭
- **Jump to Definition**: Precisely locate the source of any function, class, or variable across the entire project.
- **Find References**: Track all call sites and usages of a specific symbol for safe refactorings.
- **Knowledge Graph**: Persists relationships (call, import, inheritance) in a local SQLite graph for fast traversal.
- **Import Resolution Engine**: Language-specific logic (Python, TS/JS, Dart) to map standard imports to physical files.

### 5. Git Integration & Stability ⚡
- **Authorship Tracking**: Automatically extracts author and last-modified timestamps for every code chunk.
- **Project Pulse**: Real-time reporting of the active branch and count of stale files (>30 days).
- **Parallel Git Fetching**: Uses a strict semaphore (max 10) for parallel git subprocesses to ensure stability on Windows.
- **Async Pipeline**: Fully asynchronous file scanning and indexing.

### 6. GPU-Ready Vector Search 🚀
- **BGE-M3 (1024 dims)**: Uses the state-of-the-art embedding model via **Ollama**.
- **LanceDB**: Local-first vector storage for sub-millisecond query performance.
